# Girafa-Zglobie

The first game I made in Unity â€“ a fun and challenging endless runner!

Girafa Zglobie is a 2D arcade game where you guide a floppy, bouncing giraffe through obstacles. Inspired by the classic mechanics of Flappy Bird, this project is a playful recreation with unique elements like parallax scrolling and high-score tracking.
Features:

- Parallax Background/Ground Animation: Smooth scrolling background and ground for a visually dynamic experience.
- Simple & Intuitive Controls: Tap or press to make the giraffe jump through obstacles.
- Score Tracking: Keeps track of your current and high scores.
- Start Menu & Game Over Screen: Navigate easily between attempts.
- Endless Gameplay: See how far you can go without hitting an obstacle!

Tech Highlights:

- Scripts for parallax effects, player movement, scoring, and UI.
- UI design with Unity's Canvas system for the start menu and game over screen.
- A great starting point for learning Unity 2D game development.
